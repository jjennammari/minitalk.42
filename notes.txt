		UNIX SIGNALS: SIGUSR1 SIGUSR2: these are user defined signals that terminate the process.

				Signals are software interrupts that are sent to a process to interrup the current execution to deliver a message. For example user actions, errors
				or termination requests.

		TO DO
				- Figure out how to create a server and print it's PID
				- Find out how to create a client and is there other concrete tasks of client besides taking PID and string as parameters and sending the string to server
				- Learn about UNIX signals (SIGUSR1, SIGUSR2)
				- What it means that server must be able to recieve strings from several clients in a row. I need to create several clients?
				- Learn about the given functions to use in the project and how they can help me

		ALL ABOUT SERVER

				WHAT IS A SERVER?

						Server is a special type of a computer that provides information to other computers called "clients" on a computer network.
								- Computer network = a group of communicating computers known as hosts which communicate data to other hosts

				WHAT SERVERS ARE USED FOR?

						Servers are used to serve the clients. They provide services for clients like: store and manage data, perform computations, share computer system
			   			resource components etc..
								- Computation: is any type of arithmetic or non-arithmetic calculation that is well defined
										- Non-arithmetic calculation: deliberate mathematical process that transforms a plurality of inputs into a singular or plurality of
										outputs / Laskenta on harkittu matemaattinen prosessi, joka muuntaa useita syötteitä yhdeksi tai useammaksi tuotokseksi.
								- Computer system resource components:
										- Hardware: Physical parts of a computer: CPU, RAM, motherboard etc..
										- Software: Computer programs that instruct the execution of a computer

				WHAT IS A SERVER PID?

						PID = Process ID, it is a unique number for every process. It is assigned automatically by the system's kernel.

								WHAT PID IS USED FOR?

										- Process Management
										- Monitoring
										- Troubleshooting
										- Process termination
										- Inter-process communication (= prosessien välinen viestintä)

								HOW TO FIND PID

										Using ps command. Can differ with os. For example in linux: ps aux | grep <program_name>
